About Me
<br>
I am a Computer Vision researcher, a nerd and fan of classical/digitized music.
<br>
I currently live in Ithaca, New York, employed as a Research Intern at Cornell University under the supervision of the great plum tree Professor Kilian Weinberger. My research interests are Action/Interaction Recognition in videos, Panoramic Stitching and Image Quality Assessment.
<br>
Coding makes me happy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hearing from you makes me happy, too.
<br>
Please contact me thru email.
