About Loyo
<br>
<br>
My name is Luyu Yang, many people call me Loyo.
<br>
I am a CVML nerd and fan of classical/digitized music.
<br>
Check out my new composition with Medly on SoundCloud [Rolling Beans](https://soundcloud.com/luyu-yang-942026816/rollin-beans).
<br>
<br>
Currently I live in College Park, Maryland, a Ph.D. at University of Maryland under the supervision of the great [Professor Larry Davis](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/lsdavis). My research interests are: Action/Interaction analysis in videos, Multi-view geometry and Image Forensics.
<br>
<br>
Research makes me happy.
<br>
A message from you makes me happy as well.
<br>
