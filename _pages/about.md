Hi, welcome to my website!
<br>
I am a third-year Ph.D. student from University of Maryland Perception & Intelligence, working with [Prof. Abhinav Shrivastava](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~abhinav/) and [Prof. Larry Davis](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~lsd/). My research interests lie in learning and reasoning, domain adaptation, mainly from the perspective of vision.
